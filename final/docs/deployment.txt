To deploy the cluster, start services in this order:

1.) Persistent Volume Claim
    - kubectl apply -f mdo572-final-PVC.yml
2.) Redis Service
    - kubectl apply -f mdo572-final-redis-service.yml
3.) Redis Deployment
    - kubectl apply -f mdo572-final-redis.yml
4.) Flask Service
    - kubectl apply -f mdo572-final-flask-service.yml 

At this point, ensure that the spec.template.spec.containers.env.name:value feild in mdo572-final-flask.yml is set to the IP address of your redis service.
Your redis service IP address can be found using the command 'kubectl get services'

5.) Flask Deployment
    - kubectl apply -f mdo572-final-flask.yml
        - I could not get this to work. It worked fine for HW7. The logs were giving me this error:
        Fatal error, can't open config file '/data/redis.conf': No such file or directory
        Not only is the directory there, but I'm not sure why the flask app is trying to connect it. I cannot find anywhere in the kubernetes or docker files
		to change that parameter. I need to move on though
6.) Worker deployment
	Make sure this redis IP matches too
