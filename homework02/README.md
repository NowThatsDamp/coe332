# Homework 2
This folder contains the updated read_animals script. The new functionality includes 2 new flags:
- The -H flag allows you to choose the head shape of the pulled animal.
- The -i flag allows you to cose the index of the pulled animal, i.e the first animal on the list, or the second, ect. When combined with the -H flag, the -i flag chooses which animal to pull relative to that head, i.e the first animal with a snake head, or the second animal with a snake head, ect.
- Using the -H flag without the -i flag will return the first animal on the list with that head
- Using no flags will return a random animal
